# BankChurnPrediction

Starting from a piece of user-related data, from data preprocessing, feature engineering and coding, 
to modeling analysis and parameter tuning optimization, the entire process analysis of the entire user churn warning has been completed. 
The accuracy rate of the overall model has reached 95%, and the recall rate has reached 84.2%.

Clean the sample dataset and then perform data exploration analysis. 

Feature engineering through data visualization, cross-tab statistical analysis, etc. 

SMOTE sampling was used to balance the data.

Three models were built for prediction and the models were compared.Using parameter modeling, tuned and optimized the model.
